# Cashier-Mpesa
Mpesa Intergration with Laravel Cashier https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/billing

Laravel Cashier provides an expressive, fluent interface to Stripe's and Braintree's subscription billing services. It handles almost all of the boilerplate subscription billing code you are dreading writing. In addition to basic subscription management, Cashier can handle coupons, swapping subscription, subscription "quantities", cancellation grace periods, and even generate invoice PDFs.

The intention of this project is to offer a subscription model through m~pesa.

##NOTE
If you're only performing "one-off" charges and do not offer subscriptions. You should not use Cashier. You should use the M-PESA API directly.
